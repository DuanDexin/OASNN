* Pretrained SNN + Adaptive Activation Scaling + Unsupervised entropy loss with temperature smooth + Confidence based instance weighting loss for detection â€”>  Online Adaptation for Remote Sensing
	* Starting with a pretrained SNN model, we design an efficient, unsupervised online adaptation algorithm, which adopts an approximation of the BPTT algorithm and only involves forward-in-time computation that significantly reduces the computational complexity of SNN adaptation learning.
  * we propose an adaptive activation scaling scheme to boost online SNN adaptation performance, particularly in low time-steps.
  * Furthermore, for the more challenging remote sensing detection task, we propose a confidence-based instance weighting scheme, which substantially improves adaptation performance in the detection task.

## Results
* State-of-the-art results on seven datasets across classification, segmentation, and detection tasks.
* To our knowledge, this work is the first to address the online adaptation of SNNs.
